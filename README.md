# GoBedmasEvaluator

This project is primarily to compare the C++, Go, and Rebol programming languages.

# To Do

Get the CPP version to handle more complicated input

# Execution Speed

Rebol seems to be approximately 10X slower than the go version.
Surprisingly, the C++ version, written by a friend, seems to be slower than the Go version.
However if the cpp function is executed twice then the second run will be faster than Go
hinting that it may be the initial memory allocation that is the bottleneck for the CPP version.
